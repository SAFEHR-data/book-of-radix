### Antimicrobial Resistance

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global problem, with an estimated 1.9 million deaths attributable to it annually forecast by 2050 (GBD 2021 Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators, 2024, 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01867-1). In 2019, it was estimated to cause more deaths than HIV/AIDS or Malaria. Within England, the burden of AMR is increasing with London comprising the highest rates of resistant bacteraemia.  AMR rates are highest in deprived areas and certain ethnic groups, with particular impact on children and the elderly (ESPAUR 23-24 report), groups which are frequently underrepresented in clinical trials \[REF].&#x20;
