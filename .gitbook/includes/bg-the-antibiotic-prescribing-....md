### The Antibiotic Prescribing Problem

* Most antibiotics are given empirically before culture results are available.
* Empiric prescribing is through probabilistic clinical assessment of the likely source of infection e.g. urine, chest etc, but clinicians may also start treatment to cover multiple potential sources where there is uncertainty.
* Where a particular source is suspected, clinical guidelines exist to help standardise care.  Guidelines are produced by combining best available evidence on population level treatment effectiveness, with local data on bacteria prevalence and resistance patterns.  Guidelines also reflect best practices with respect to antimicrobial stewardship, e.g. limiting the use of extended-spectrum agents where possible to reduce resistance.
* However, clinicians vary in how they apply these guidelines in practice, in some cases showing low levels of concordant prescribing e.g. 58% concordance in CAP (BTS audit data). &#x20;
* Variation may be warranted, for example under conditions of diagnostic uncertainty, or where there is additional information about pre-existing treatment failure or known antimicrobial resistance. &#x20;
* However, variation may also be unwarranted where guideline-based care is appropriate and not followed, potentially leading to over or undertreatment, treatment failure, and antimicrobial resistance.&#x20;
