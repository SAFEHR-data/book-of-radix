### The EHR Opportunity for Antibiotics

* The NHS 10-year plan calls for all NHS trusts to have adopted a digital electronic patient record (EPR) by March 2026.
* With increasing adoption of comprehensive EPRs, including electronic prescribing and linkage across other electronic health records, there is the potential to create learning health systems for improving antibiotic use.
* This may be through:
  * Modification of the EPR architecture to improve antibiotic prescribing practices.&#x20;
    * \[REF]
  * Interceding with antibiotic prescriptions in real-time via computerised clinical decision support systems (CDSS).&#x20;
    * The [INSPIRE cluster randomised trial](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] demonstrated that computerised provider order entry (CPOE) prompts reduced use of extended spectrum antibiotics.(Gohil _et al._, 2024, [https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.6248](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.6248))
  * Linkage across EHRs to deliver additional information not normally visible to clinicians at the point of antibiotic prescribing.
