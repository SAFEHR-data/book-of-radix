The Inglés trials are layered randomised controlled trials working to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing through point of care decision support (PoC-DS). The layering allows us to safely and efficiently introduce an increasingly complex intervention. In each layer, the trial targets the same population, and works to improve the same overarching outcome, but as the decision support becomes more sophisticated then the design adapts.

We provide a worked _example_ focusing on antibiotic prescribing in patients with urinary tract infections. The three layers are described below.

<table><thead><tr><th width="84.64453125">Layer</th><th width="267.41015625">Layer name</th><th>Point of care information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Inglés-<strong>G</strong>uidelines</td><td>A hospital antibiotic guideline reminder</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Inglés-<strong>R</strong>esistance</td><td>Historical antibiotic resistance profile</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Inglés-<strong>E</strong>stimated Susceptibility</td><td>Predicted antibiotic resistance</td></tr></tbody></table>

The overarching patient centred outcome is a reduction in patient morbidity and mortality by reducing bug-drug mismatches, antibiotic side-effects (e.g. diarrhoea), and the risk of future antibiotic resistance (by reducing exposure to antibiotics on the watch or reserve [lists](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aware-antibiotic-classification/uk-access-watch-reserve-and-other-classification-for-antibiotics-uk-aware-antibiotic-classification)). The primary endpoints depend on the layer.
