# Contributing

Documentation will always be incomplete, outdated, or wrong.\
We need your help to make it better.

If you find anything outdated or wrong, or something new that needs documenting, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/SAFEHR-data/book-of-radix/issues/new/choose).

#### Discussion

We aim to centralise design decision discussions on GH issues rather than for these to proliferate across Slack, email, Teams etc.\
To ask a question or offer a proposal, simply [create an issue](https://github.com/SAFEHR-data/book-of-radix/issues/new/choose) and tag appropriately.

#### Workflow

Use the `[gh-username]/[issue-type]-[issue-number]-[issue-title]` branching convention and favour short-lived branches.

Common issue types are

* `feat` - new functionality, structure or content
* `fix` - bug fix, proofing or similar
* `chore` - maintenance work, no content change

\
Raise Pull Requests against `main` for review.\
Use the branch name as the PR title.\
The person approving the review is responsible for merging and deleting the branch.

#### Diagrams

Diagrams are created with the [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net) aka [draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) tool.\
The default _.drawio_ file format used by this tool is plain text and easy to manage with Git.\
Export to _PNG_ for rendered output.\
Keep both raw diagrams and exported PNGs in the _diagrams_ directory.
