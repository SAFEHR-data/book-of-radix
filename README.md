# Welcome to the Book of RADIX

**RADIX** is the **R**eal-time **A**ntimicrobial **D**igital **I**ntervention e**X**change programme run jointly by UCLH, UCL and HSL.

This the documentation for RADIX which in turn is composed of the following projects.

- [Camino](https://github.com/SAFEHR-data/Camino): Our UCLH data pipeline (Private)
- Digital Fragmentation and Antibiotics
- Antibiotic Passport
- RADIX models (baby, and big brother)
- ...

This repository is built collaboratively and in the open.

RADIX will build a comprehensive patient-level data asset that augments existing London SDE data (including primary and acute care antibiotic prescribing, antimicrobial testing and cancer status) with new pathology flows (e.g., microbiology) and care home status insights.

Data will be ingested via the London SDE’s London Data Service (LDS) for unified analysis while high-performance computing tasks, such as model training, will be supported by UCL ARC’s Trusted Research Environment.

The project will deliver four key outputs:

- Integrated patient-prescribing dashboard
- Quantitative Digital Fragmentation Analysis
- Bug-Drug Mismatch Prediction Models
- Pandemic Preparedness Demonstrator

RADIX aims to deliver real-time, actionable insights that improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

By improving antibiotic prescribing for Londoners, immediate harm can be reduced from bug-drug mismatches (BDM), as well as future harm from growing AMR.

RADIX could also be used to support other infections as part of pandemic preparedness.
